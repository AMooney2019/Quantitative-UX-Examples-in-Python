### Introduction:
Anova, or Analysis of Variance, is a common tool used in statistics. For those new to Statistics,
the concept of an Anova seems frightening; it's not once you understand how it works.

An Anova works upon the following assumptions:
- Independent samples are randomly drawn from a population;
- The samples have the same or similar levels of variance (known as homogeneity of variance);
- Each sample value, or score, includes a component of random, normally distributed 'experimental error'.

In a nutshell, and if I understand it correctly, the test compares the ratio of the experimental error values between-groups compared to
the values within-groups. In the absence of treatment effects, the ratio of experimental errors should be close to 1.0. 
Ratios above 1.0 indicate that the score values are influenced by something in addition to the error, possibly one or more treatment
effects. This value is then compared against a set of tabled F values to determine the probability that the calculated value occurs by 
some level of chance. 

### Usage:
The files in this folder include a basic script used for calculating an Anova (.py file), along with some example tables of data (.csv files).
While this code is primarily included as a learning tool, it can be used by practitioners who do not have access to commercial statistics packages
to quickly test and report on a set of experimental data. Once a Python environment is set up, calculating test values using this script 
should be much faster than using a spreadsheet. 

### Limitations:
While a test such as an Anova can indicate whether differences in sample values are significant or not, the test does not indicate
which variable level is 'the winner'; it only indicates if the value differences between groups is statistically significant. 
For data where only two levels of a test variable are compared, determining 'the winner' should be straight-forward. 
When three or more levels are evaluated, however, additional post-hoc tests are required. This script doesn't cover those post-hoc tests.
