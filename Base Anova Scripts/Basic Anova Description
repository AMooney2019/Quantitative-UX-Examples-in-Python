Anova, or Analysis of Variance, is a common tool used in statistics. For those new to Statistics,
the concept of an Anova seems frightening; it's not once you understand how it works.

An Anova works upon the following assumptions:
- Independent samples are randomly drawn from a population;
- The samples have the same or similar levels of variance (known as homogeneity of variance);
- Each sample value, or score, includes a component of random, normally distributed 'experimental error'.

In a nutshell, and if I understand it correctly, the test compares the ratio of the experimental error values between-groups compared to
the values within-groups. In the absence of treatment effects, the ratio of experimental errors should be close to 1.0. 
Ratios above 1.0 indicate that the score values are influenced by something in addition to the error, possibly one or more treatment
effects. This value is then compared against a set of tabled F values to determine the probability that the calculated value occurs by 
some level of chance.
